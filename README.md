# Planify - Todo Application

Planify is a simple yet powerful todo application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, and delete tasks, and track their progress by dragging and dropping tasks between different categories (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done") or by selecting options from a dropdown.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to manage their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Progress Tracking**: Users can update the progress of tasks by dragging and dropping them between categories or by selecting options like "In Progress" and "Done".
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
